# Stepwise

### Turn tutorial videos into a knowledge base that answers questions with the exact step — and the screenshot to prove it.

Stepwise ingests YouTube videos, Google Drive recordings, Notion docs, and screenshots, then uses Claude to decompose them into structured, timestamped, **visually-grounded steps**. Ask a question in plain English and get a cited answer that links back to the precise moment in the source video.

## The problem

Support and onboarding knowledge is trapped in **video**. A 30-minute screencast might contain the one answer a user needs at the 14:32 mark — but nobody can search it, cite it, or surface it inside a support ticket. Transcripts alone aren't enough: half the information in a UI tutorial is *on the screen*, not in the narration ("click **here**, then toggle **this**").

**Stepwise makes video as searchable as documentation** — without throwing away the visual half of the signal.

```

## What makes it interesting

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎥 **Multimodal structuring** | Claude reads transcript + screenshots at ingest time. Steps are indexed as fused **text + CLIP-image** vectors (896-dim); retrieval is **text-first** over visually enriched descriptions. |
| 🧠 **HyDE retrieval** | Embeds a hypothetical *answer* instead of the question — closing the question↔instruction vocabulary gap. ([deep dive →](docs/hyde.md)) |
| 🔁 **Auto-ingestion** | Watch a YouTube channel, Drive folder, or Notion database. New content is detected and ingested automatically — reactive becomes proactive. |
| 🔍 **Gap detection** | Clusters queries the library *couldn't* answer well, names each gap with Claude, and suggests exactly what tutorial to record next. |
| 💸 **Cost-engineered** | Haiku for high-volume extraction, scene-change frame dedup, and prompt caching cut the expensive ingestion path by a large margin — without dropping the visual modality. |
| 🎫 **Ships where work happens** | A Zendesk sidebar app surfaces relevant steps on the active ticket and inserts a cited, timestamped link with one click. |

## The ingestion pipeline

Every source — a YouTube URL, a Drive `.mp4`, a Notion page, a folder of PNGs — is normalised into the **same artifact shape** (`transcript[]` + `frames[]`) and then run through one shared pipeline:

```
download ─→ transcribe ─→ extract frames ─→ dedup frames ─→ align segments
                                                                  │
   index ◄─ filter trivial ◄─ consolidate ◄─ Claude extracts steps
```

1. **Download & transcribe** — captions when available, Whisper fallback when not. Notion skips this entirely (text-first, no video).
2. **Frame extraction** — `ffmpeg` samples a frame every N seconds.
3. **Scene-change dedup** — a 32×32 grayscale diff drops near-identical consecutive frames *before* they ever reach Claude. A presenter talking to camera for 30 seconds collapses from 6 frames to 1.
4. **Semantic alignment** — transcript is chunked on sentence boundaries, with window size that **scales to video length** (fine-grained for shorts, coarse for hour-long talks).
5. **Claude structuring** — each segment (transcript + up to 2 frames) becomes typed steps via tool-use: `{title, description, action_type, confidence}`. When there's no transcript, Claude reads the steps straight off the screenshots.
6. **Consolidate & filter** — merge fragments toward ~1 step/minute, drop intros, outros, and "like & subscribe" filler.

## The retrieval pipeline

```
query ─→ HyDE ─→ text embed (384-d) + zero visual half ─→ tutorial pre-filter ─→ vector search ─→ cross-encoder ─→ dedup ─→ synthesize
        (Haiku)              (896-d fused query vector)      (centroid gate)        (ChromaDB)      (MiniLM rerank)         (Haiku, streamed)
```

- **HyDE** — Claude writes a hypothetical answer-shaped step; *that* gets embedded, not the raw question. Conversation history is included so follow-ups like *"how do I undo that?"* resolve correctly. ([why this works →](docs/hyde.md))
- **Text-first retrieval** — query vectors use HyDE text + a **zero visual half** (no CLIP at query time). Visual context enters search through Claude-extracted step descriptions; screenshots are returned as evidence, not used for image-to-image matching. See [docs/hyde.md](docs/hyde.md) for the full embedding scheme.
- **Tutorial pre-filter** — a per-tutorial **centroid** index gates the search: if one tutorial is clearly relevant, search is scoped to it; otherwise it falls back to the full corpus.
- **Cross-encoder re-rank** — `ms-marco-MiniLM` re-scores the top candidates for precision the bi-encoder can't reach alone.
- **Near-duplicate suppression** — steps ≥85% textually similar collapse to the best-ranked copy.
- **Streaming synthesis** — the answer streams token-by-token over SSE, grounded **only** in retrieved steps, with each step carrying its timestamp and frame.

Every query is logged with full telemetry (latencies, distances, cross-encoder scores) — which is exactly what powers **gap detection**.

## 💸 Cost engineering

Ingestion is the expensive path — it's where the multimodal LLM calls happen. Three levers cut that cost hard while **keeping** the visual modality intact:

| Lever | What it does | Why it's free quality |
|---|---|---|
| **Haiku for extraction** | Step extraction is a fixed-schema tool-use task. Haiku does it as well as Sonnet, at roughly an order of magnitude lower cost per token. | Sonnet is reserved for consolidation, where judgment matters most; extraction, HyDE, and synthesis run on Haiku. |
| **Scene-change frame dedup** | Drops near-identical frames before they're encoded as base64 and sent to Claude — often **40–60%** fewer image tokens on screencast content. | Identical frames carry zero new visual information. |
| **Prompt caching** | The structuring system prompt is marked `cache_control: ephemeral` — served from cache on every segment after the first. | Same prompt, every call. Pure win. |

The design principle: **cut tokens, not modalities.** A transcript-only system would be cheaper still — but it would lose half the information in a UI tutorial.

## Watch sources & gap detection

The endgame is a system that tells you *what to record next* and ingests it the moment it appears.

```

- **Watchers** (`/watchers`) track YouTube channels (via public RSS — no API key), Drive folders (modified-time diff), and Notion databases (last-edited filter). A built-in APScheduler job polls every active source on an interval (default 30 min) and auto-queues anything new — no external cron required. `POST /watchers/poll` triggers an immediate check.
- **Gaps** (`/gaps`) embeds poorly-served queries, clusters them by cosine similarity, and asks Claude to name each gap with a suggested tutorial title and YouTube search terms.

---

## Configuration

Set via `.env` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(required)* | Claude API key |
| `STRUCTURING_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Step extraction (high volume) |
| `HYDE_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | HyDE hypothetical-answer generation |
| `SYNTHESIS_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Streamed answer synthesis |
| `CONSOLIDATION_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Step consolidation (judgment) |
| `FRAME_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `5` | Frame sampling interval |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Text embedding model |
| `DRIVE_TOKEN_PATH` | `./data/drive_token.json` | Google Drive OAuth token |
| `WATCHER_POLL_ENABLED` | `true` | Run the auto-ingestion scheduler in-process |
| `WATCHER_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `30` | How often watched sources are polled |
| `API_KEY` | *(unset)* | When set, require `X-API-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` on all routes except `/health` and `/docs` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma-separated allowed origins, or `*` for local dev |

When `API_KEY` is set, the **API**, **web BFF** (`API_KEY` in the Next.js server env — forwarded automatically via `web/lib/backend.ts`), **Zendesk sidebar** (optional `api_key` app setting), and scripts must include the key in requests. Leave it unset for local development.

### Choosing Claude models

Every Claude model ID lives in [`stepwise/config.py`](stepwise/config.py) — none are hard-coded in the pipeline. Each stage has its own setting so you can trade cost against quality independently:

- **`STRUCTURING_MODEL`** — high-volume step extraction; a fast, cheap model (Haiku) is the sweet spot.
- **`HYDE_MODEL`** — generates a hypothetical answer to steer retrieval; latency-sensitive, so a fast model works well.
- **`SYNTHESIS_MODEL`** — writes the final streamed answer; also fast by default.
- **`CONSOLIDATION_MODEL`** — merges and cleans extracted steps, where judgment matters most; a stronger model (Sonnet) is worth the cost.

**Model IDs change over time.** The defaults pin the models this project was built against — before changing them, check Anthropic's model overview for the current recommended IDs and pricing:

**https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview**

At the time of writing, the current model IDs are `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-4-8`, and `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Override any stage via its environment variable (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)) — for example, `CONSOLIDATION_MODEL=claude-opus-4-8` to use a more capable model for consolidation.

## Evaluation

A 25-query retrieval harness ([`scripts/run_eval.py`](scripts/run_eval.py)) replays realistic support questions against a tutorial corpus and scores each result **PASS / PARTIAL / MISS**, broken down by topic, against a 70% pass-rate target.

```bash
python scripts/run_eval.py                 # interactive scoring
python scripts/run_eval.py --auto          # dump results, no scoring
```

---

## Design philosophy

> **Cut tokens, not modalities.** The cheapest system would read transcripts and stop there. Stepwise keeps the visual signal during **multimodal structuring** — Claude reads screenshots when extracting steps — and returns frame evidence with answers. Query-time search is text-first over those visually enriched descriptions.
